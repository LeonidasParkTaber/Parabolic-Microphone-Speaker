# Parabolic Microphone / Speaker

An exploration of designing a parabolic speaker / microphone, then testing its capabilities.  
This project was inspired by learning about the special properties of paraboloids in multivariable calculus.

Skills:
- Onshape
- Designing for 3D printing
- Designing for ease of assembly
- Developing methods for testing capabilities of designs
- Data analysis with Excel

Any ray that enters a parabola parallel to its axis is reflected toward the focus, and any ray emitted from the focus exits the parabola parallel to the axis.

*As a challenge to myself, no outside research was conducted beyond this theorem. Everything that follows is based on my own reasoning, design process, and work.*

As a speaker, a paraboloid can be used to direct sound waves into a narrow, nearly parallel beam, reducing sound spread and loss. As a microphone, the same geometry focuses incoming sound waves toward a central point, increasing the effective signal strength.

## Desgin and Fabrication

Design was done on ONSHAPE, broken into 9 square sections to be printed induviualy then assembled into the dish. To reduce filament, minimal settings were used: a 10% infil and 1 wall layer thick. To increase  dencity of matiral at location conact of the sound waves (frot of the dish) and hopefully improve reflection, the back wall was brought foward to almost meet the front way, making the thinkess of the wall the sound waves come in contact to from 1 to 3.
