# Parabolic Microphone / Speaker

An exploration of parabolic speakers and microphones.  
This project was inspired by learning about the special properties of paraboloids in multivariable calculus.

Any ray that enters a parabola parallel to its axis is reflected toward the focus, and any ray emitted from the focus exits the parabola parallel to the axis.


*As a challenge to myself, no outside research was conducted beyond this theorem. Everything that follows is based on my own reasoning, design process, and work.*

As a speaker, a paraboloid can be used to direct sound waves into a narrow, nearly parallel beam, reducing sound spread and loss. As a microphone, the same geometry focuses incoming sound waves toward a central point, increasing the effective signal strength.
